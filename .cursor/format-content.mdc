Format this content in the md style. 
Add emojis, ## titles and good spacing.
Where you feel like its necessary use Woz component 
It works like that 

<Woz
title='Recap'
description='Make sure you really understand ðŸ™ƒ'
prompt='Now use the Feynman method and ask me 3 questions one by one about this chapter content to make sure I really understand the material.'
/>
 
 title and description is optional. It sends a message inside "propmp" to our AI tutor Woz and he will based on that message anwser to the user. 
 
 Put it in placeses of the content where it make sense to ask user questions to make sure he really understand. 

 Also if in the content there are some new conspets you can use woz like that 

<Woz
prompt='Explain user how caching works and draw a diagrams using ascii art'
/>
