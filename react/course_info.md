# React Foundations

## Introduction

To effectively learn Next.js, it helps to be familiar with JavaScript, React, and related web development concepts. However, JavaScript and React are vast topics. How do you know when you're ready to start using Next.js?

Welcome to the React Foundations course! This beginner-friendly, example-led course will guide you through the prerequisite knowledge for Next.js. You will build a simple project step-by-step; starting with a JavaScript application, then migrating it to React and finally Next.js.

Each section builds on the previous one, so you can choose where to start depending on what you already know.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

This tutorial assumes knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and no knowledge of React. If you're already familiar with React, you can skip to the "From React to Next.js" chapter or take the Dashboard App course.

Before you start this course, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 18.17.0 or later.
