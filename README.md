## About 👽

It's an MVP for my startup Homebrew College Club that aims to democratise elite education like Homebrew Computer Club democratize computing. I needed some good course content to demonstrate how [Homebrew](https://homebrew.so) can make it 10x better with the power of AI.

## Why? 🤔

I never been the sharpest tool in the shed yet I always loved learning that's why I need very efficient tools and everything I used sucked super hard so I build something much better.🧠💪 Plus I'm like 99,9% sure that legacy education system will colapse and we need a new solution.
