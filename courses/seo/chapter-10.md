# Rendering and Ranking

10

Chapter 10

JavaScript is an important part of the web development ecosystem. In the past, most programming languages were sending all content directly from the server.

With technology like JavaScript, fetching information from the browser became more popular than ever. This, in turn, affected search engines and their
ability to understand pages, as most bots were only parsing the initial HTML from the server and loading it to the browser.

In this lesson, we'll talk about:

- Rendering strategies, such as Client-Side Rendering (CSR), Incremental
Static Regeneration (ISR), Static Site Generation (SSG), and Server-Side
Rendering (SSR).
- How URL structure can impact SEO ranking.
- Incorporating headings and internal links to optimize your search engine
results page ranking.

Let's dive in!
