title: Multi-Step & Generative UI
---

Your chatbot can already call tools, but we can make it more powerful. Right now, when you ask for weather in multiple cities, the model makes separate calls - let's enable it to handle multiple steps intelligently. And those tool results? We can render them as custom React components instead of debugging displays.

In this lesson, you'll enable **multi-step conversations** where the AI can chain multiple tool calls together, and **generative UI** where tool results render as custom React components instead of the Elements Tool components.

## What We're Building

Try asking your current chatbot: "What's the weather in San Francisco and New York?"

You'll get weather data, but the flow feels incomplete. We can make this much more intelligent by allowing the AI to:

1.  Make multiple tool calls
2.  Synthesize a natural language response
3.  Display results in custom UI components instead of debug tool cards

Good news: Your template already includes a polished `Weather` component ready to use! We'll integrate it to replace the tool debugging display.

## Step 1: Enable Multi-Step Conversations

Right now, if you ask "What's the weather in San Francisco and New York?", the AI makes tool calls but doesn't provide a natural language summary afterward. Let's fix that!

### Why Multi-Step is Required

Without multi-step, the AI must choose ONE action per request:

*   **Either** call tools (one or multiple)
*   **Or** generate a text response
*   **Not both!**

This limitation means:

*   ❌ Can't call weather tool AND explain the results
*   ❌ Can't make sequential tool calls based on previous results
*   ❌ Can't provide a synthesis after gathering data

Multi-step conversations solve this by allowing the AI to take multiple "steps" where each step can:

1.  Call one or more tools in parallel
2.  Process tool results
3.  Decide to call more tools OR generate a response
4.  Finally synthesize everything into natural language

Learn more about [multi-step interfaces](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/advanced/multistep-interfaces) and [stepCountIs](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/step-count-is) in the documentation.

The key is adding `stopWhen` configuration to your API route:

```typescript
app/api/chat/route.ts

import { streamText, convertToModelMessages, stepCountIs } from 'ai';
import { getWeather } from './tools';

// In your POST function:
const result = streamText({
  model: "openai/gpt-4.1", // Fast model for multi-step workflows with tool chaining
  system: `You are a helpful assistant. When using tools, only mention
    capabilities you actually have. The weather tool provides current
    temperature, conditions, and humidity only - no forecasts.`,
  messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
  tools: { getWeather },
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(5), // ADD THIS: Enables up to 5 steps
});
```

>Understanding stepCountIs
>
>The `stepCountIs(5)` allows up to 5 "steps" in the conversation. Here's what might happen:
>
>**Example flow for "Weather in SF and NYC?":**
>
>*   **Step 1**: AI calls `getWeather("San Francisco")` and `getWeather("New York")` in parallel
>*   **Step 2**: AI receives both results and generates text response comparing them
>
>**Example flow for complex query:**
>
>*   **Step 1**: AI calls first tool
>*   **Step 2**: Based on results, AI calls another tool
>*   **Step 3**: AI processes all data
>*   **Step 4**: AI generates final response
>*   **Step 5**: (Buffer for edge cases)

>Use `stepCountIs(2)` for simple tool + response, `stepCountIs(5)` for most cases, or `stepCountIs(10)` for complex multi-tool scenarios. Each step uses tokens, so balance capability with cost.

### Testing Multi-Step Behavior

1.  **Save your changes** to `app/api/chat/route.ts`
    
2.  **Restart your dev server** if needed: `pnpm dev`
    
3.  **Navigate to** `http://localhost:3000/chat`
    
4.  **Test these queries** to see multi-step in action:
    
    **Single city (baseline):** "What's the weather in Tokyo?"
    
    *   Expected: One tool call, then a response
    
    **Multiple cities:** "What's the weather in San Francisco and New York?"
    
    *   Expected: Two tool calls, then a synthesis comparing both
    
    **Complex query:** "Compare the weather in London, Paris, and Berlin"
    
    *   Expected: Three tool calls, then a comprehensive comparison

![Screenshot of the chat UI showing the two tool calls and the natural language summary](/assets/aisdk-course-multistep-tool-call-enabled.png)

You should now see:

1.  Tool calls for each city (shown as Tool components)
2.  A natural language summary that synthesizes all the data

>How Multi-Step Works
>
>When the AI makes a tool call, the result automatically feeds back into the conversation context. The model then decides whether to:
>
>*   Make another tool call
>*   Provide a text response
>*   Both
>
>![Screenshot showing tool error handling: The tool-getWeather component displays 'fetch failed' error, but the AI provides a helpful recovery message offering alternatives](/assets/aisdk-course-tool-call-failure.png)
>
>This even works when tools fail! If a tool returns an error, the AI can acknowledge the failure and offer alternatives or retry suggestions.

## Step 2: Build Generative UI with Weather Components

Right now, tool results display using the Elements `Tool` component - which works great for debugging but isn't very user-friendly. **Generative UI** means rendering custom React components based on tool data. Instead of showing tool execution details, let's create visual weather cards that users actually want to see.

### Understanding the Weather Component

Your template includes `app/(5-chatbot)/chat/weather.tsx` - a pre-built Weather component. Let's understand what it provides:

```typescript
app/(5-chatbot)/chat/weather.tsx

import {
  Cloud,
  Sun,
  CloudRain,
  CloudSnow,
  CloudFog,
  CloudLightning,
} from "lucide-react";

export interface WeatherData {
  city: string;
  temperature: number;
  weatherCode: number;
  humidity: number;
}

function getWeatherIcon(weatherCode: number) {
  if (weatherCode === 0) return <Sun size={48} />;
  if (weatherCode === 1 || weatherCode === 2) return <Cloud size={48} />;
  if (weatherCode === 3) return <CloudFog size={48} />;
  if (weatherCode >= 51 && weatherCode <= 67) return <CloudRain size={48} />;
  if (weatherCode >= 71 && weatherCode <= 77) return <CloudSnow size={48} />;
  if (weatherCode >= 80 && weatherCode <= 99) return <CloudLightning size={48} />;
  return <Sun size={48} />;
}

function getWeatherCondition(weatherCode: number): string {
  if (weatherCode === 0) return 'Clear sky';
  if (weatherCode === 1) return 'Mainly clear';
  if (weatherCode === 2) return 'Partly cloudy';
  if (weatherCode === 3) return 'Overcast';
  // Add more conditions as needed
  return 'Unknown';
}

export default function Weather({ weatherData }: { weatherData: WeatherData }) {
  return (
    <div className="text-white p-6 rounded-2xl backdrop-blur-lg bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-400 via-blue-500 to-blue-600 shadow-lg max-w-sm">
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">{weatherData.city}</h2>
      <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
        <div>
          <p className="text-4xl font-light mb-1">{weatherData.temperature}°C</p>
          <p className="text-lg opacity-90">
            {getWeatherCondition(weatherData.weatherCode)}
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="ml-6" aria-hidden="true">
          {getWeatherIcon(weatherData.weatherCode)}
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="mt-4 flex items-center">
        <CloudFog size={16} aria-hidden="true" />
        <span className="ml-2 text-sm">Humidity: {weatherData.humidity}%</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This component:

*   Exports `WeatherData` interface with city, temperature, weatherCode, and humidity that is used in the component props
*   Maps weather codes to appropriate icons (sun, clouds, rain, snow, etc.)
*   Renders a gradient card with the weather information
*   Has a fallback to default San Francisco weather if no data is provided

### Update Your Chat Page

Now let's integrate the Weather component. We need to:

1.  Import the Weather component
2.  Conditionally render it for successful tool results
3.  Keep the Tool component as fallback for loading/error states

**TODO: Before looking at the solution below, try to:**

1.  Add `import Weather from "./weather";` after your other imports (around line 24)
2.  Find the `case "tool-getWeather":` section in your switch statement
3.  Add a conditional check: if `part.state === "output-available" && part.output`
    *   Render `<Weather weatherData={part.output} />`
    *   Otherwise, keep the existing Tool component
4.  Make sure to keep the same key prop pattern

**💡 Hints if you're stuck**
- The Weather component expects a prop called `weatherData`
- Check `part.state === "output-available"` to know when the tool succeeded
- You'll need both the Weather import AND keep the Tool imports for fallback
- The conditional goes inside the case statement, not around it

**Solution:**

```typescript
app/(5-chatbot)/chat/page.tsx

"use client";

import { useState } from "react";
import { useChat } from "@ai-sdk/react";
import {
  Conversation,
  ConversationContent,
  ConversationEmptyState,
} from "@/components/ai-elements/conversation";
import { Message, MessageContent } from "@/components/ai-elements/message";
import { Response } from "@/components/ai-elements/response";
import {
  Tool,
  ToolContent,
  ToolHeader,
  ToolInput,
  ToolOutput,
} from "@/components/ai-elements/tool";
import {
  PromptInput,
  PromptInputTextarea,
  PromptInputSubmit,
} from "@/components/ai-elements/prompt-input";
import Weather from "./weather";

export default function ChatPage() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState("");
  const { messages, sendMessage, status } = useChat();

  const isLoading = status === "streaming" || status === "submitted";

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col h-screen">
      <Conversation>
        <ConversationContent>
          {messages.length === 0 ? (
            <ConversationEmptyState
              title="Start a conversation"
              description="Type a message below to begin"
            />
          ) : (
            messages.map((message) => (
              <Message key={message.id} from={message.role}>
                <MessageContent>
                  {message.role === "assistant"
                    ? message.parts?.map((part, i) => {
                        switch (part.type) {
                          case "text":
                            return (
                              <Response key={`${message.id}-${i}`}>
                                {part.text}
                              </Response>
                            );
                          case "tool-getWeather":
                            // Show Weather component for completed tool calls
                            if (part.state === "output-available" && part.output) {
                              return (
                                <Weather
                                  key={part.toolCallId || `${message.id}-${i}`}
                                  weatherData={part.output}
                                />
                              );
                            }
                            // Show tool UI for other states (loading, error)
                            return (
                              <Tool key={part.toolCallId || `${message.id}-${i}`}>
                                <ToolHeader type={part.type} state={part.state} />
                                <ToolContent>
                                  <ToolInput input={part.input} />
                                  <ToolOutput
                                    output={JSON.stringify(part.output, null, 2)}
                                    errorText={part.errorText}
                                  />
                                </ToolContent>
                              </Tool>
                            );
                          default:
                            return null;
                        }
                      })
                    : message.parts?.map(
                        (part) => part.type === "text" && part.text
                      )}
                </MessageContent>
              </Message>
            ))

            event.preventDefault();
            if (message.text) {
              sendMessage({ text: message.text });
              setInput("");

            placeholder="Type your message..."
            disabled={isLoading}
            rows={1}
            className="flex-1"
          />
          <PromptInputSubmit disabled={isLoading} />
        </PromptInput>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Implementation Guide

The key changes you made:

1.  **Line 24**: Import the `Weather` component from `./weather`
2.  **Lines 56-63**: Modified the `tool-getWeather` case to:
    *   Check if `part.state === "output-available"` (tool completed successfully)
    *   If yes → Render the custom `Weather` component with the data
    *   If no → Keep showing the `Tool` component for loading/error states

This conditional rendering pattern lets you show polished UI for success while maintaining debugging visibility for errors.

### Test Your Implementation

**Try it:** Ask "What's the weather in Tokyo?" and you should see a styled weather card instead of the tool display!

![Screenshot of chat UI. User asks for weather. A styled 'Weather' card component appears, visually displaying temperature, city, and condition. Final text answer follows.](/assets/aisdk-course-ui-tokyo-weather.png)

>Preventing AI Overpromising
>
>Notice in the screenshot the AI might offer "more details or a forecast"? Our system prompt in Step 1 helps prevent this by explicitly stating what the tool provides. If you still see overpromising, you can:
>
>*   Make the tool description more explicit: `description: "Returns ONLY current temperature, weather code, and humidity - no forecasts available"`
>*   Add validation in your tool's execute function to return clear capability messages
>*   Implement the additional features the AI keeps promising!

Perfect! Now you have polished weather cards that display instead of tool debugging info.

## Key Takeaways

You've built a sophisticated chatbot with multi-step tool use and custom UI components:

*   **Multi-Step Conversations:** Use `stopWhen: stepCountIs(5)` server-side to enable the AI to make multiple tool calls and synthesize results.
*   **Generative UI:** Render custom React components based on tool results (`part.state === 'output-available'`) instead of generic tool displays.
*   **Message Parts:** AI SDK 5.0 uses `message.parts` array structure with typed tool parts like `tool-getWeather`.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Show custom components for successful results, fallback to tool UI for loading/error states.
