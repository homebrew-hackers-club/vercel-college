Here are the topics we’ll cover

What Partial Prerendering is.

How Partial Prerendering works.

## Combining Static and Dynamic Content

Currently, if you call a [dynamic function](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers#dynamic-functions) inside your route (e.g.`noStore()`, `cookies()`, etc), your entire route becomes dynamic.

This is how most web apps are built today. You either choose between static
and dynamic rendering for your **entire application** or for a **specific
route**.

However, most routes are _not_ fully static or dynamic. You may have a route
that has both static and dynamic content. For example, consider an [ecommerce
site](https://partialprerendering.com/). You might be able to prerender the
majority of the product page, but you may want to fetch the user's cart and
recommended products dynamically on-demand.

Going back to your dashboard page, what components would you consider static
vs. dynamic?

## What is Partial Prerendering?

Next.js 14 contains a preview of **Partial Prerendering** – an experimental
feature that allows you to render a route with a static loading shell, while
keeping some parts dynamic. In other words, you can isolate the dynamic parts
of a route. For example:

![Partially Prerendered Product Page showing static nav and product
information, and dynamic cart and recommended products](/_next/image?url=%2Flearn%2Flight%2Fthinking-in-ppr.png&w=3840&q=75)![Partially Prerendered Product Page showing static nav and product information, and dynamic cart and recommended products](/_next/image?url=%2Flearn%2Fdark%2Fthinking-in-ppr.png&w=3840&q=75)

When a user visits a route:

- A static route shell is served, ensuring a fast initial load.
- The shell leaves holes where dynamic content will load in asynchronous.
- The async holes are streamed in parallel, reducing the overall load time of the page.

This is different from how your application behaves today, where entire routes
are either entirely static or dynamic.

Partial Prerendering combines ultra-quick static edge delivery with fully
dynamic capabilities and we believe it has the potential to [become the
default rendering model for web applications](https://vercel.com/blog/partial-
prerendering-with-next-js-creating-a-new-default-rendering-model), bringing
together the best of static site generation and dynamic delivery.

## How does Partial Prerendering work?

Partial Prerendering leverages React's [Concurrent
APIs](https://react.dev/blog/2021/12/17/react-conf-2021-recap#react-18-and-
concurrent-features) and uses
[Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) to defer rendering
parts of your application until some condition is met (e.g. data is loaded).

The fallback is embedded into the initial static file along with other static
content. At build time (or during revalidation), the static parts of the route
are _prerendered_ , and the rest is _postponed_ until the user requests the
route.

It's worth noting that wrapping a component in Suspense doesn't make the
component itself dynamic (remember you used `unstable_noStore` to achieve this
behavior), but rather Suspense is used as a boundary between the static and
dynamic parts of your route.

The great thing about Partial Prerendering is that you don't need to change
your code to use it. As long as you're using Suspense to wrap the dynamic
parts of your route, Next.js will know which parts of your route are static
and which are dynamic.

## Summary

To recap, you've done a few things to optimize data fetching in your
application, you've:

1. Created a database in the same region as your application code to reduce latency between your server and database.
2. Fetched data on the server with React Server Components. This allows you to keep expensive data fetches and logic on the server, reduces the client-side JavaScript bundle, and prevents your database secrets from being exposed to the client.
3. Used SQL to only fetch the data you needed, reducing the amount of data transferred for each request and the amount of JavaScript needed to transform the data in-memory.
4. Parallelize data fetching with JavaScript - where it made sense to do so.
5. Implemented Streaming to prevent slow data requests from blocking your whole page, and to allow the user to start interacting with the UI without waiting for everything to load.
6. Move data fetching down to the components that need it, thus isolating which parts of your routes should be dynamic in preparation for Partial Prerendering.

In the next chapter, we'll look at two common patterns you might need to
implement when fetching data: search and pagination.
