Before you can continue working on your dashboard, you'll need some data. In
this chapter, you'll be setting up a PostgreSQL database using
`@vercel/postgres`. If you're already familiar with PostgreSQL and would
prefer to use your own provider, you can skip this chapter and set it up on
your own. Otherwise, let's continue!

In this chapter...

Here are the topics weâ€™ll cover

Push your project to GitHub.

Set up a Vercel account and link your GitHub repo for instant previews and
deployments.

Create and link your project to a Postgres database.

Seed the database with initial data.

## Create a GitHub repository

To start, let's push your repository to Github if you haven't done so already.
This will make it easier to set up your database and deploy.

If you need help setting up your repository, take a look at [this guide on
GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-
a-repo).

> **Good to know:**
>
> - You can also use other Git provider like GitLab or Bitbucket.
> - If you're new to GitHub, we recommend the [GitHub Desktop
>   App](https://desktop.github.com/) for a simplified development workflow.

## Create a Vercel account

Visit [vercel.com/signup](https://vercel.com/signup) to create an account.
Choose the free "hobby" plan. Select **Continue with GitHub** to connect your
GitHub and Vercel accounts.

## Connect and deploy your project

Next, you'll be taken to this screen where you can select and **import** the
GitHub repository you've just created:

Name your project and click **Deploy**.

button](/\_next/image?url=%2Flearn%2Flight%2Fconfigure-

project.png&w=1920&q=75)

Hooray! ðŸŽ‰ Your project is now deployed.

domain, and deployment status](/\_next/image?url=%2Flearn%2Fdark%2Fdeployed-
project.png&w=1920&q=75)

By connecting your GitHub repository, whenever you push changes to your
**main** branch, Vercel will automatically redeploy your application with no
configuration needed. When opening pull requests, you'll also have [instant
previews](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments#preview-
urls) which allow you to catch deployment errors early and share a preview of
your project with team members for feedback.

## Create a Postgres database

Next, to set up a database, click **Continue to Dashboard** and select the
**Storage** tab from your project dashboard. Select **Connect Store** â†’
**Create New** â†’ **Postgres** â†’ **Continue**.

![Connect Store screen showing the Postgres option along with KV, Blob and
Edge Config](/\_next/image?url=%2Flearn%2Flight%2Fcreate-
database.png&w=1920&q=75)![Connect Store screen showing the Postgres option
along with KV, Blob and Edge
Config](/_next/image?url=%2Flearn%2Fdark%2Fcreate-database.png&w=1920&q=75)

Accept the terms, assign a name to your database, and ensure your database
region is set to **Washington D.C (iad1)** \- this is also the [default
region](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/regions#select-
a-default-serverless-region) for all new Vercel projects. By placing your
database in the same region or close to your application code, you can reduce
[latency](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
US/docs/Web/Performance/Understanding_latency) for data requests.

![Database creation modal showing the database name and
region](/\_next/image?url=%2Flearn%2Flight%2Fdatabase-
region.png&w=1920&q=75)![Database creation modal showing the database name and
region](/_next/image?url=%2Flearn%2Fdark%2Fdatabase-region.png&w=1920&q=75)

> **Good to know** : You cannot change the database region once it has been
> initalized. If you wish to use a different
> [region](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres/limits#supported-
> regions), you should set it before creating a database.

Once connected, navigate to the `.env.local` tab, click **Show secret** and
**Copy Snippet**. Make sure you reveal the secrets before copying them.

![The .env.local tab showing the hidden database
secrets](/\_next/image?url=%2Flearn%2Flight%2Fdatabase-
dashboard.png&w=1920&q=75)![The .env.local tab showing the hidden database
secrets](/\_next/image?url=%2Flearn%2Fdark%2Fdatabase-
dashboard.png&w=1920&q=75)

Navigate to your code editor and rename the `.env.example` file to **`.env`**.
Paste in the copied contents from Vercel.

**Important:** Go to your `.gitignore` file and make sure `.env` is in the
ignored files to prevent your database secrets from being exposed when you
push to GitHub.

Finally, run `npm i @vercel/postgres` in your terminal to install the [Vercel
Postgres SDK](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres/sdk).

## Seed your database

Now that your database has been created, let's seed it with some initial data.
This will allow you to have some data to work with as you build the dashboard.

In the `/scripts` folder of your project, there's a file called `seed.js`.
This script contains the instructions for creating and seeding the `invoices`,
`customers`, `user`, `revenue` tables.

Don't worry if you don't understand everything the code is doing, but to give
you an overview, the script uses **SQL** to create the tables, and the data
from `placeholder-data.js` file to populate them after they've been created.

Next, in your `package.json` file, add the following line to your scripts:

```json
/package.json

    "scripts": {
      "build": "next build",
      "dev": "next dev",
      "start": "next start",
      "seed": "node -r dotenv/config ./scripts/seed.js"
    },
```

This is the command that will execute `seed.js`.

Now, run `npm run seed`. You should see some `console.log` messages in your
terminal to let you know the script is running.

> **Troubleshooting** :
>
> - Make sure to reveal your database secrets before copying it into your
>   `.env` file.
> - The script uses `bcrypt` to hash the user's password, if `bcrypt` isn't
>   compatible with your environment, you can update the script to use
>   [`bcryptjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs) instead.
> - If you run into any issues while seeding your database and want to run
>   the script again, you can drop any existing tables by running `DROP TABLE
tablename` in your database query interface. See the executing queries
>   section below for more details. But be careful, this command will delete the
>   tables and all their data. It's ok to do this with your example app since
>   you're working with placeholder data, but you shouldn't run this command in
>   a production app.
> - If you continue to experience issues while seeding your Vercel Postgres
>   database, please open a [discussion on
>   GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/issues).

## Exploring your database

Let's see what your database looks like. Go back to Vercel, and click **Data**
on the sidenav.

In this section, you'll find the four new tables: users, customers, invoices,
and revenue.

![Database screen showing dropdown list with four tables: users, customers,
invoices, and revenue](/\_next/image?url=%2Flearn%2Flight%2Fdatabase-
tables.png&w=2048&q=75)![Database screen showing dropdown list with four
tables: users, customers, invoices, and
revenue](/_next/image?url=%2Flearn%2Fdark%2Fdatabase-tables.png&w=2048&q=75)

By selecting each table, you can view its records and ensure the entries align
with the data from `placeholder-data.js` file.

## Executing queries

You can switch to the "query" tab to interact with your database. This section
supports standard SQL commands. For instance, inputting `DROP TABLE customers`
will delete "customers" table along with all its data - **_so be careful_**!

Let's run your first database query. Paste and run the following SQL code into
the Vercel interface:

    SELECT invoices.amount, customers.name
    FROM invoices
    JOIN customers ON invoices.customer_id = customers.id
    WHERE invoices.amount = 666;

## You've Completed Chapter 6

With your database now set up and integrated, you can continue building your
application.

Let's discuss the different ways you can fetch data from your database,
including using APIs, SQL, and alternatives.
