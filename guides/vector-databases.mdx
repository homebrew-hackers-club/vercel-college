## Introduction

With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Anthropic's Claude, the demand for efficient ways to handle and process vast amounts of data has surged. While many are familiar with standard relational databases, the unique requirements of LLMs often necessitate more specialized tools. This has led to the emergence of vector databases.

## What is a Vector Database?

A vector database is designed to convert data—usually textual—into multi-dimensional vectors (also known as vector embeddings) and store them accordingly. These vectors serve as mathematical representations of characteristics or qualities. The number of dimensions in each vector can vary widely, from just a few to several thousand, based on the data's complexity and detail level.

This structure allows for efficient analysis and comparison of data points, enabling tasks such as similarity searches and clustering. Utilizing vectors in a database enhances data processing capabilities and supports advanced data-driven applications.

Imagine you're writing a lengthy research paper. Instead of reading each page individually, you have a special folder that turns every page into a unique barcode representing the main points and details. Some barcodes might be simple with just a few lines, while others are incredibly complex with thousands of lines, depending on the content's depth. Now, if you want to find pages with similar themes or group them by topics, you can quickly compare their barcodes. This method makes managing and understanding your research much easier and more efficient, similar to how vector databases handle and analyze data.

## Examples of Vector Databases

There are several vector databases available in the market today. Here are some of the most popular ones, based on usage in AI apps built on Vercel:

- **Pinecone**: A fully managed vector database service that makes it easy to add vector search to production applications.
- **Weaviate**: An open-source vector search engine that stores both objects and vectors, allowing for efficient retrieval.
- **Milvus**: An open-source vector database designed for scalable similarity search and AI applications.
- **Qdrant**: A vector similarity search engine and database that provides fast and scalable search capabilities.
- **Vespa**: A real-time big data serving engine that enables applications to perform computations over large datasets at serving time.
- **Vald**: A highly scalable distributed vector search engine featuring automatic vector indexing and real-time updates.
- **ElasticSearch with k-NN plugin**: An extension to ElasticSearch that adds support for approximate nearest neighbor search on vectors.
- **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.

## How to Use a Vector Database

Using a vector database is similar to using any other kind of database, though the operations may vary based on the specific nature of vector data. Here's a simple guide to get started:

1. **Installation & Setup**: Begin by choosing the right vector database for your needs. Once chosen, follow the provided installation guide. Many databases offer cloud-based solutions, so setup can be as simple as creating an account.

2. **Data Ingestion**: Import your vector data into the database. This step might require you to convert your data into a vector format if it isn't already.

3. **Querying**: Once your data is in place, you can start querying the database to find similar vectors or perform analytical operations. Most vector databases provide a query language or an API tailored to handle vector operations.

4. **Maintenance & Scaling**: As with any database, monitor performance, handle backups, and ensure that your database scales with your needs.

## Building a Semantic Search App with Vercel Postgres and pgvector

In this guide, we will learn how to build a semantic search Pokédex app using Vercel Postgres and `pgvector` as the vector database.

You can check out a [live demo](https://postgres-pgvector.vercel.app/), or [deploy your own](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/postgres-pgvector) version of the template with one click.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository and Set Up Required Environment Variables

First, [clone the repository](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/storage/postgres-pgvector) and download it locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/storage/postgres-pgvector
```

Next, set up environment variables in your repo's `.env.local` file. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`. You will then need to add the following environment variables: OpenAI API key, which you can find [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), as well as your Postgres credentials.

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=

POSTGRES_URL=

POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING=

POSTGRES_USER=

POSTGRES_HOST=

POSTGRES_PASSWORD=

POSTGRES_DATABASE=
```

For the purpose of this guide, we'll use a free Postgres database hosted on Vercel. First, go to your Vercel dashboard and select the Storage tab. Then select the Create Database button, choose Postgres, and then click Continue.

To create a new database, do the following in the dialog that opens:

1. Enter `sample_postgres_db` (or any other name you wish) under Store Name. The name can only contain alphanumeric letters, "_" and "-" and can't exceed 32 characters.
2. Select a region. We recommend choosing a region geographically close to your function region (defaults to US East) for reduced latency.
3. Click Create.

Our empty database is now created in the specified region.
